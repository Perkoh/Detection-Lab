# Detection Lab

## Objective

This project demonstrates the integration of Splunk for log analysis and visualization with Wireshark for network traffic capture and analysis. The project focuses on setting up Splunk for detecting and alerting on network anomalies, analyzing network traffic with Wireshark, and correlating findings to enhance network security.

### Skills Learned

- Ability to configure Splunk to ingest and index various types of log data, including network logs, security logs, and system events.
- Proficiency in using Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL) to query, filter, and analyze data for insights and anomalies.
- Skills in creating interactive dashboards and visualizations in Splunk to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats.
- Experience in setting up and configuring alerts in Splunk to notify you of suspicious activities or anomalies in real time.
- Proficiency in using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, including understanding packet structures and protocols.
- Ability to decode and interpret various network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP) to understand traffic patterns and detect anomalies.
- Skills in applying filters in Wireshark to isolate specific types of traffic or conversations for detailed analysis.
- Ability to detect and analyze network anomalies and potential security incidents using both Splunk and Wireshark.
- Skills in identifying signs of malicious activities, such as unusual traffic patterns, suspicious protocols, and unauthorized access attempts.
- Experience in investigating and responding to network security incidents, including analyzing logs and network traffic to determine the scope and impact.

### Tools Used

- Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark and Tcpdump) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Packet captures from online platforms to get abressed with network attacks and attack scenarios.
